A game made by team HawkEyes of IITK. 
TERRITORIAL ATTACK
TEAM HawkEyes - IGD Team 6
Tools: Blender, Unity, Photoshop
Platform: Windows/PC, Android

Setting
Our surrounding is divided into two territories in which one is occupied by our main hero and the other is occupied by our enemies who have stolen some precious assets from our territory. Each level will have a different environment and surroundings.
                         
Characters
The characters include our main hero, the enemies, the items/objects (like a hammer, stones, paper balls, shoe, arrow) used to shoot at the enemies, and the assets that we need to collect from the enemies in the other territory and deliver on our side.

Goal
The goal is to kill the enemies and recover the stolen assets within a stipulated time limit preserving your health (or else the enemies will revive) to get coins and advance to the next level.

Challenge
As we advance to further levels the number of enemies will increase, the time limit will decrease, the enemies will start moving and have the ability to shoot back at the hero. Later levels will also witness wind factors that will affect the projectile trajectory.

Rules

1.	The projectile’s direction and power will be shown by an arrow.
2.	The objective of the level is to recover the stolen asset and deliver it back before the enemies revives.
3.	There will be a health bar of each character displaying their current health status.
4.	The health bar will decrease on being hit by the other person. The amount of decrement will depend on the object with which it is hit.
5.	As the level advances powerups will come up. The following powerups will be provided: -
a.	Laser Tracker: - shows the complete trajectory of the projectile.
b.	Health Refill: - restores the health of our player by 20%.
c.	Shield Mode (for 5 seconds) : - provides a shield to protect from the attacks of the enemies. 
d.	Missile Launcher: gives high damage
6.	Score will be shown after each level based on the clean shot, killing enemies, delivering assets, amount of time left after delivery.
7.	As the game progress, if the player hits in without miss fire then it gets a consecutive chance to attack.
8.	A Timer starts after killing all the enemies.
9.	The health of the player increases by 10% on advancing to the next level and not resetting it.

**In the process of making the game, we will decide to add the timer feature and revival of the enemy feature.
